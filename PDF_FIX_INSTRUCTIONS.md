# PDF Upload Fix - Quick Instructions

## The Issue
PDF files were not being processed correctly - they were showing "I've received your file" instead of analyzing the content.

## The Fix
I've updated the PDF processing code with better error handling and debugging. The system now uses the `pypdf` library (which is already in your requirements.txt) instead of PyPDF2.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the API
Use the new startup script:
```bash
python start_neo_api.py
```

OR run directly:
```bash
python api_clean.py
```

### 3. Upload and Ask
1. Upload your PDF file using the ðŸ“Ž button
2. You should see a detailed analysis with:
   - Document summary
   - Page count and word count
   - Metadata (if available)
   - Extracted content
3. Ask follow-up questions like:
   - "What does this PDF say about [topic]?"
   - "Summarize the main points"
   - "Search for [keyword]"

## What Changed
1. Fixed PDF detection logic to be case-insensitive
2. Added extensive debug logging to track processing
3. Updated from PyPDF2 to pypdf (already in requirements)
4. Added fallback PDF processing for edge cases
5. Improved follow-up question detection

## Debug Output
When you upload a PDF, check the terminal/console for messages like:
- "Starting PDF extraction..."
- "PDF reader created successfully. Pages: X"
- "Total text extracted: X characters, Y words"

If you see errors, they will help identify the issue.

## Still Having Issues?
1. Check that pypdf is installed: `pip show pypdf`
2. Try a different PDF file to rule out file corruption
3. Check the console for specific error messages
4. The PDF might be image-based (scanned) without text
