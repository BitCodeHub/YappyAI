## 🔷 Option 2: Vercel + Railway

Split frontend and backend for better performance.

### Frontend (Vercel):
1. **Deploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/agentic-seek-front
   npm run build
   ```
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect to Vercel
   - Deploy automatically

### Backend (Railway):
   - Deploy just the Python API on Railway
   - Update frontend to point to Railway backend URL

## 🐳 Option 3: Docker + Any Host

Use the provided Dockerfile with any Docker hosting service.

### Supported Platforms:
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Google Cloud Run**
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**
- **Azure Container Instances**
- **Fly.io**

### Deploy Steps:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to your chosen platform
3. Set build source to Dockerfile
4. Deploy!

## 🏠 Option 4: Self-Hosted

For full control, host on your own server.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- 2GB+ RAM
- Docker (optional)

### Setup:
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd agenticSeek-main

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend/agentic-seek-front
npm install && npm run build
cd ../..

# Start server
python api_clean.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### For Production:
1. **CORS**: Already configured for all origins
2. **Static Files**: Frontend served at root path
3. **API Endpoints**: Auto-detect production vs development
4. **Security**: No hardcoded API keys, users provide their own

### Custom Domain:
- Railway: Add custom domain in dashboard
- Vercel: Add domain in project settings
- Others: Configure DNS to point to your host

## 📱 Usage After Deployment

1. **Users visit your deployed URL**
2. **Register/Login** with username and password
3. **Choose LLM provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. **Enter their API key** for chosen provider
5. **Start chatting** with Yappy!

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ No hardcoded API keys in code
- ✅ User API keys only stored during session
- ✅ Complete cleanup on logout
- ✅ Secure authentication system
- ✅ HTTPS enforced on most platforms

## 🎯 Recommended: Railway Deployment

Railway is the easiest option for beginners:

1. **One-click deployment** from GitHub
2. **Automatic HTTPS** and domain
3. **Built-in monitoring** and logs
4. **Free tier** to get started
5. **Easy scaling** as you grow

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Build fails**: Check Python/Node versions in Dockerfile
- **API errors**: Ensure CORS is properly configured
- **Frontend 404**: Verify static files are being served correctly

### Getting Help:
- Check deployment platform logs
- Test locally first with production build
- Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt
